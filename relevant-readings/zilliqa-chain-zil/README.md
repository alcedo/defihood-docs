# Zilliqa Chain \(ZIL\)

Zilliqa is a public, permissionless [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain) that is designed to offer high throughput with the ability to complete thousands of transactions per second. It seeks to solve the issue of blockchain scalability and speed by employing sharding as a second-layer scaling solution. The platform is home to many [decentralized applications](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps), and as of October 2020, it also allows for [staking](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) and [yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-farming).

Development work officially started on Zilliqa in June 2017, and its testnet [went live](https://blog.zilliqa.com/zilliqa-testnet-v1-0-release-codename-red-prawn-27974ca46ecb) in March 2018. A little over a year later, in June 2019, the platform [launched](https://blog.zilliqa.com/zilliqa-mainnet-the-launch-and-beyond-4cd7e113369f) its mainnet.

The native utility token of Zilliqa, ZIL, is used to process transactions on the network and execute smart contracts.

#### Who Are the Founders of Zilliqa? <a id="who-are-the-founders-of-zilliqa"></a>

Zilliqa was first conceived by Prateek Saxena, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore School of Computing. Saxena and several students in the School of Computing published a paper in 2016 that outlined how a sharding-focused blockchain could improve network efficiency and speed.

Around the same time, Saxena co-founded Anquan Capital alongside Max Kantelia, a lifelong finance and tech entrepreneur, and Juzar Motiwalla, former president of the Singapore Computer Society. The company incorporated Zilliqa Research in June 2017 to develop the Zilliqa network, bringing on Dong Xinshu as its CEO, Yaoqi Jia as its chief technology officer and Amrit Kumar as its chief scientific officer. All three previously worked as research fellows at the NUS School of Computing.

**What Makes Zilliqa Unique?**

Zilliqa [claims](https://www.zilliqa.com/platform) to be the world's first public blockchain to rely entirely on a sharded network. This allows it to achieve high throughput and a high rate of transactions per second, which it says solves the scalability issue. Because each shard processes transactions individually, as the network grows and the number of shards increases, the number of transactions that can be processed per second also increases. As well, records are immediately added to the Zilliqa blockchain after being processed, meaning that no additional time for confirmation is required.

Zilliqa seeks to become the blockchain of choice for large-scale enterprise use, including among the advertising, gaming, entertainment and financial services and payments industries. In its 2018 position paper, its team [states](https://docs.zilliqa.com/positionpaper.pdf) that the platform "aims to rival traditional centralized payment methods such as VISA and MasterCard."

Both Anquan Capital and Zilliqa Research, the company responsible for developing Zilliqa, hold significant reserves of ZIL.

As of 2021, the Zilliqa network is an active network that runs over [millions of transactions](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/stat/txCountHistory) each month. The blockchain has also been constantly scaling, going from averaging over 900 blocks produced a day when its main net launched to presently producing [over 2500 blocks](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/stat/blockCountHistory) a day.
