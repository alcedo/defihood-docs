# XSGD - Singapore Stablecoin

XSGD is the fully collateralized Singapore Dollar stablecoin, powered by open-source blockchain protocols. All Xfers issued SGD-backed stablecoins have 1:1 parity with Singapore Dollar.

XSGD tokens are available on two distinct blockchain protocols:

1. XSGD \(ERC-20\) tokens run on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-20 tokens and can be stored with any ERC-20 compatible wallet. 
2. XSGD \(ZRC-2\) tokens run on the Zilliqa blockchain as ZRC-2 tokens and can be stored with any ZRC-2 compatible wallet. 

The digital asset space is growing and current use cases for XSGD are distinct from future use cases.

Today, XSGD can be used as a stable store of value and unit of account denominated in Singapore Dollar in digital assets markets. XSGD tokens can also be used to remove cross-border transaction fees and to move seamlessly between physical and digital assets, or as means of payment for other digital assets. 

In the future, XSGD will also be used for both B2B and consumer payments.

If this is your first time withdrawing XSGD to your wallet \(Ex: Moonlet, MyEtherWallet, MetaMask\), and XSGD is not yet supported there, ensure you have added the XSGD token address.

Under its MPI license for e-money issuance activity, Xfers can only mint as many XSGD tokens as possible provided that the corresponding fiat is safeguarded in segregated accounts with a fully regulated MAS-approved bank. Each XSGD token is fully backed one-for-one by the Singapore Dollar \(SGD\) and represents one SGD.
