# Polygon Chain \(MATIC\)

[Polygon ](https://polygon.technology/)\(Previously MATIC network\) is a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Aggregating scalable solutions on Ethereum supporting a multi-chain Ethereum ecosystem.

_"Polygon combines the best of Ethereum and sovereign blockchains into a full-fledged multi-chain system.  
  
Polygon solves pain points associated with Blockchains, like high gas fees and slow speeds, without sacrificing on security. This multi-chain system is akin to other ones such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche etc, but with at least three major upsides:_

* _It is able to fully benefit from Ethereumâ€™s network effects_
* _It is inherently more secure_
* _It is more open and powerful"_
